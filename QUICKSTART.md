## API Error Logging

Every API call is logged with:

- Error message
- Timestamp
- Request details
- Response status

### Example Log Entries

**Successful Upload:**
```
‚úÖ Success: {
  context: "Complete File Upload",
  message: "File upload completed successfully",
  timestamp: "2025-10-29T12:34:56.789Z",
  filename: "document.pdf",
  fileId: "f3cde45f-6789-0123-b4c5-d6e7f8a9b0c1"
}
```

**Failed Login:**
```
‚ùå API Error: {
  context: "User Login",
  error: "Invalid username or password",
  timestamp: "2025-10-29T12:34:56.789Z",
  endpoint: "/login",
  status: 401
}
```

**Network Error:**
```
‚ùå API Error: {
  context: "List My Files",
  error: "Network error - cannot reach server",
  timestamp: "2025-10-29T12:34:56.789Z",
  endpoint: "/my-files"
}
```

## Configuration

### Backend URL

Update the backend URL in `vite.config.js`:

```javascript
server: {
  proxy: {
    '/api': {
      target: 'http://localhost:3000',  // Change this to your backend URL
      changeOrigin: true
    }
  }
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Can't login after registration
- Make sure you're using the same username and password
- Check browser console for error messages (enable logging)

### Upload fails
- Check file size (ensure backend supports the size)
- Enable logging to see detailed error messages
- Check network tab in browser dev tools

### Files not loading
- Ensure you're logged in
- Check backend connection
- Look for errors in console (enable logging)

### Session expired
- Log out and log back in
- Sessions are stored in localStorage and persist across page refreshes

## Development Tips

### Hot Module Replacement (HMR)
- Changes to `.vue` files auto-reload
- Changes to stores/services may require manual refresh
- CSS changes update instantly

### State Management
- Auth state in `stores/auth.js`
- Files state in `stores/files.js`
- State persists in Pinia stores

### Adding New Features
1. API calls go in `services/api.js`
2. Components go in `components/` or `views/`
3. Routes go in `router/index.js`
4. Always use the logger for error tracking
